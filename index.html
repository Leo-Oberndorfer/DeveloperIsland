                            Hey, I am Mango the parrot! To make coding more fun we have our own competition system called "Coconut Coding" where you can compete against other developers and earn xp. The top 50 developers with the most xp will be displayed on the <a href="#">leaderboard</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To earn xp you will have to complete challenges posted by our team members. The challenges have different difficulties which will range from 1 to 10. The higher the difficulty, the harder the challenge and the more xp you can earn. There are also some kind of requirements for each challenge which will give you different amount of xp when completed. All together they sum up to the maximum amount of obtainable xp.
                        </p>
                        <img src="assets/prize.png" class="col-md-6 float-md-start mb-3 ms-md-3" alt="Prize">
                        <p>
                            To make the competition even more intense we give away prizes sometimes (Maybe once a month or so). We pick someone from the first page of the leaderbaord and grant them their prize. I won't tell you what the prizes are, this would ruin the tension ;)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Did you know: you can enlarge prizes by <a href="#">donating</a>. We use 70% of donations for events and giveaways including Coconut Coding. The other 30% will be split up amongst our team members who actively support Developer Island.
                        </p>
                        <p>
